				<h2><var>Math.min() > Math.max()</var></h2>
				<br />
<p>
Why <var>Math.min() > Math.max()</var> is <var>true</var> ?
<br><br>
<var>console.log( Math.min() ); // Infinity</var><br>
<var>console.log( Math.max() ); // -Infinity</var>
<br><br>
Writing <var>Math.min()</var> as well as Math.max() without arguments, is like looking for the lower and upper bound of an empty set.
<br><br>
So we should have something that looks like this:

<br><br>
    Let 𝐸 = ∅,
    <var>inf(𝐸)</var> > <var>sup(𝐸)</var>
    <br><br>

So it makes sense to write <var>Infinity > -Infinity</var>
<br><br>
But why?
<br><br>
To begin with, we have:
<br><br>
<strong>(A)</strong>
<br>
For any nonempty set of real numbers 𝐸 with an upper bound in ℝ, there exists a smaller upper bound. We call this <var>sup(𝐸)</var>. For any nonempty set of real numbers 𝐸 having a lower bound in ℝ, there exists a larger lower bound. We call this <var>inf(𝐸)</var>.
<br><br>
Right.
<br><br>
Now, suppose we have any set 𝐸 ⊆ 𝑅. We define 𝑈(𝐸):= {𝑥 ∈ ℝ : ∀ 𝑦 ∈ 𝐸 (𝑦 ≤ 𝑥)} as the set of upper bounds of 𝐸 in ℝ.
<br><br>
Similarly,
<br>
let 𝐿(𝐸) := {𝑥 ∈ ℝ : ∀ 𝑦 ∈ 𝐸 (𝑥 ≤ 𝑦)} be the set of lower bounds of 𝐸.
<br><br>
We can then show that:
<br>
𝑈(𝐸) is an upwardly closed set, i.e. if 𝑥 ∈ 𝑈(𝐸) and 𝑧 ∈ ℝ with 𝑥 ≤ 𝑧, then 𝑧 ∈ 𝑈(𝐸). <br><br>
Similarly, 𝐿(𝐸) is downwardly closed.<br><br>
The only upwardly closed subsets of ℝ are ∅, ℝ, and sets of the form (𝑎, →) := {𝑥 ∈ ℝ : 𝑎 < 𝑥} and [𝑎, →) := {𝑥 ∈ ℝ : 𝑎 ≤ 𝑥} for 𝑎 ∈ ℝ.<br><br>
Similarly, the closed subsets down of ℝ are ∅, ℝ, and the sets (←, 𝑏) := {𝑥 ∈ ℝ : 𝑥 < 𝑏} and (←, 𝑏] := {𝑥 ∈ ℝ : 𝑥 ≤ 𝑏}.<br><br>
- ℝ is the only upwardly closed subset of the reals that is unbounded below.<br>
- ℝ is the only subset of the downward closed reals that is unbounded above.<br>
- 𝐸 = ∅ if and only if 𝑈(𝐸) = 𝐿(𝐸) = ℝ.<br><br>
Perfect!<br><br>
Now let's rephrase <strong>(A)</strong> more concisely:<br><br>
<strong>(A rephrased)</strong> <br>
For any nonempty set of real numbers 𝐸, either 𝑈(𝐸) is empty, which meansthat 𝐸 has no upper bound in ℝ.<br>
Let 𝑈(𝐸) have a least element, which means that 𝑈(𝐸) = [𝑎, →) for some 𝑎 ∈ ℝ.<br>
This 𝑎 is uniquely determined by 𝐸, and we call it <var>sup(𝐸)</var>. <br>
Similarly, for any nonempty set of real numbers 𝐸, either 𝐿(𝐸) is empty,or 𝐿(𝐸) = (←, 𝑏] for some unique 𝑏 ∈ ℝ, which we call <var>inf(𝐸)</var>.<br>
In the case where 𝐸 = ∅, we have 𝑈(𝐸) = ℝ, which has no least element, so we cannot say that there exists a real number that we call <var>sup(𝐸)</var> in this case.<br>
Consequently, "<var>sup(𝐸)</var> = -∞" must be interpreted to mean that 𝑈(𝐸) is unbounded below, which is just another way of saying that 𝐸 is empty.<br>
Similarly, "<var>inf(𝐸)</var> = +∞" means that 𝐿(𝐸) is unbounded above, which is another way of saying that 𝐸 is empty.<br>
Finally, we note that if 𝐸 is nonempty and bounded above, then <var>sup(𝐸)</var> = <var>inf(𝑈(𝐸))</var>.<br><br>
In this view,
one should interpret "<var>sup(𝐸)</var> = +∞" in the same way as "<var>inf(𝑈(𝐸))</var> = +∞", i.e., 𝑈(𝐸) is
empty.
This means that 𝐸 is unbounded above.
Similarly, one should interpret "<var>inf(𝐸)</var> = -∞" to mean that 𝐸 is unbounded below.<br><br>
These conventions are generally easier to understand than "<var>sup(𝐸)</var> = -∞" and "<var>inf(𝐸)</var> = +∞"
both mean "𝐸 = ∅".<br><br>
Bottom line,
<var>console.log( Math.min() > Math.max() );</var>
is "<var>true</var>", and now it won't look weird to you.
